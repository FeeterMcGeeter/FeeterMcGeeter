                    <h2>Born, but not raised!</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Oklahoma City, but only lived in Oklahoma for my first two years of existence.  I moved to Texas and have been here ever since!  Although I've basically lived my entire life in Texas, I've never been a fan of the majority of the sports teams here.  I grew up a 49ers fan because I loved watching Jerry Rice play.  I was originally an Indiana Pacers fan because of Reggie Miller, but after he retired, they were pretty bad.  They were'nt on TV as much, so I couldn't watch them living in the DFW area.  I ended up following and rooting for the Mavericks.  The Texas Rangers have been the only team in Texas I've been a fan of since day one.</p>

                    <p>I have also been bowling for over 20 years now.  I'd probably put myself in the "above average bowler" category.  Not great, but above average.  I only have one perfect game in my 20 plus years, which is why I'd only say I'm above average.</p>
